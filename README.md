# Gym Exercise Tracker

This application was made to boost my passion and motivation throughout my fitness and health journey. The main objective of this application is to track and record the user training sessions with easy and interactable UIs.

### Technologies

- React
- Node JS
- Postgres

### Main Dependencies
- Prisma ORM
- Express
- Passport JWT
- Tailwind CSS

### Challenges
My biggest challenge in this project is learning how to integrate user authentication using the Passport JS JWT strategy. it provides me with a better understanding of how to handle user authentication and configure react routes based on user authentication and authorization. Other problems includes: 
- figuring out how to better structure my client-side project ensuring that each component only has one responsibility and not many.
- Learning to use different react hooks to better handling data across components
- Learning to use custom axios instance in order to create a custom request for Passport JWT authentication.

### Future Feature
Currently, this application is far from finished. it only has the bare minimum features to fulfill the main purpose of the application but missing many UX qualities and technical features that can provide users with more analytics for their training. This includes:
- Ensure and prevent user from submitting multiple workout session by creating a loading screen and disable the submit button after clicking once
- Ensure that user recieve a notification when they either fail or success message when submitting
- Ensure that user will recieve fail or success message when logging in
- Have a register page
- when browser refresh and user havent completed workout form, it will not be lost or reset

- progress page (big feature)
- need to change database model in order to allow user to create exercise
- change UI so that user don't type their exercise but select from avaiable ones
- user can track and compare their current performance with previous performance with an easy to understand UI
- user can see when was the last time they exercise on that muscle group

# How to Install and Run Project
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. Table of Contents (Optional)
If your README is very long, you might want to add a table of contents to make it easy for users to navigate to different sections easily. It will make it easier for readers to move around the project with ease.

4. How to Install and Run the Project
If you are working on a project that a user needs to install or run locally in a machine like a "POS", you should include the steps required to install your project and also the required dependencies if any.

Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment set and running.

5. How to Use the Project
Provide instructions and examples so users/contributors can use the project. This will make it easy for them in case they encounter a problem â€“ they will always have a place to reference what is expected.

You can also make use of visual aids by including materials like screenshots to show examples of the running project and also the structure and design principles used in your project.

Also if your project will require authentication like passwords or usernames, this is a good section to include the credentials.

6. Include Credits
If you worked on the project as a team or an organization, list your collaborators/team members. You should also include links to their GitHub profiles and social media too.

Also, if you followed tutorials or referenced a certain material that might help the user to build that particular project, include links to those here as well.

This is just a way to show your appreciation and also to help others get a first hand copy of the project.

7. Add a License
For most README files, this is usually considered the last part. It lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project.

We have different types of licenses depending on the kind of project you are working on. Depending on the one you will choose it will determine the contributions your project gets.

The most common one is the GPL License which allows other to make modification to your code and use it for commercial purposes. If you need help choosing a license, use check out this link: https://choosealicense.com/

Up to this point what we have covered are the minimump requirements for a good README. But you might also want to consider adding the following sections to make it more eye catching and interactive.

Additional README Sections
8. Badges
Badges aren't necessary, but using them is a simple way of letting other developers know that you know what you're doing.

Having this section can also be helpful to help link to important tools and also show some simple stats about your project like the number of forks, contributors, open issues etc...

Below is a screenshot from one of my projects that shows how you can make use of badges:

The good thing about this section is that it automatically updates it self.

Don't know where to get them from? Check out the badges hosted by shields.io. They have a ton of badges to help you get started. You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

9. How to Contribute to the Project
This mostly will be useful if you are developing an open-source project that you will need other developers to contribute to. You will want to add guidelines to let them know how they can contribute to your project.

Also it is important to make sure that the licence you choose for an open-source projects is correct to avoid future conflicts. And adding contribution guidelines will play a big role.

Some of the most common guidelines include the Contributor Covenant and the Contributing guide. Thes docs will give you the help you need when setting rules for your project.
